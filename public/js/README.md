# Frontend modules (`public/js/`)

This folder is the former `public/app.js` (8,740 lines) split into focused,
navigable files. This was **Phase 1** of the incremental refactor described in
`FRONTEND_REFACTORING_GUIDE.md`: reorganize first, change behavior later.

## What changed and what did NOT

- **Did NOT change:** any logic, API paths, database schema, authentication,
  visible behavior, or CSS. The split is a pure repartition of the original
  file. Concatenating these files in order reproduces the original `app.js`
  **byte for byte** — see "Verifying" below.
- **Did change:** one 8,740-line file became 26 files, each covering one area,
  and `index.html` now loads them in order instead of the single `app.js`.

## Important: these are ordered classic scripts

They are **not** ES modules. They share a single global scope exactly as the
original monolith did (`STATE`, `render()`, the `window.*` handlers, etc. are
all still globals). Therefore **load order matters and must not be changed.**
`index.html` loads them `01` → `26`; the numeric prefixes make that order
explicit. `26-boot.js` must always load last — it starts the app.

## Verifying

Dependency-free checks (syntax of each file + index.html consistency):

```bash
bash test/verify-frontend.sh
```

Full runtime smoke test (boots the app in headless Chromium via guest mode and
walks every major screen, asserting no JS errors):

```bash
npm install --no-save playwright-core
node test/frontend-smoke.mjs
```

Byte-equivalence to the original monolith (valid for the initial split commit,
before any Phase 2 edits):

```bash
# The two-digit prefixes make shell glob order match load order.
diff <(cat public/js/*.js) <(git show <split-commit>^:public/app.js)
```

## Next (Phase 2 — not done here)

Per the guide, once these boundaries and tests exist, migrate **one file at a
time** to: real ES modules with explicit imports/exports, a controlled
`getState`/`setState`/`subscribe` store, `textContent`/DOM rendering (or a
shared `escapeHtml` helper) in place of string-built HTML, event listeners in
place of inline `onclick`, and separation of guest/demo mode from production.
Each of those steps should be its own small, tested change.
